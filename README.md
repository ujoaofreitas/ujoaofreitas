# Hello, nice to meet you! I'm JoÃ£o Freitas.

**`Backend developer`**

Iâ€™m 21 years old and originally from Recife, Brazil. I completed high school at the Recife Military School (CMR) and I'm currently pursuing a degree in Systems Analysis and Development at UNIT. I'm passionate about technology and innovation, and I enjoy sharing my knowledge with others. That's why I created the ZEROUM community, where we promote collaborative learning and collective growth within the tech world.
